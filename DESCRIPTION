Authors@R: person("Christopher","Kraner",email="ckraner19@gmail.com",role=c("aut","cre"))
Description: Includes basic visualization implementations for tables from regression analyses. 
    Using PixieDust, LaTeX or HTML tables are output. Multiple summaries and results are included
    in tables to more reflect what an analyst would need. Several extended options for tables are 
    also included (VIM, partial eta, glance stats, etc.). In addition, several helper functions for 
    tasks such as saving plots and seeing labels are included.
